# ft_printf
The goal of this 42 school project is to recreate the C standard library function `printf()`. We needed to discover and use variadic function. Variadic functions are function that can take a variable number of arguments. A minimum of one is required for `ft_printf()` and an additionnal one for each conversion.
# Mandatory
The conversions that were required are the following:
  - %c, prints a char
  - %s, prints a char* (string)
  - %p, prints that address of a void*
  - %d, prints a decimal in base 10
  - %i, prints an integer in base 10
  - %u, prints an unsigned decimal in base 10
  - %x, prints a number in hexadecimal lowercase format
  - %X, prints a number in hexadecimal uppercase format
  - %%, prints a percent sign
